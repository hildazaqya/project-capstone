# Bangkit 2023 Batch 2 Capstone Team : CH2-PS364

Hello everyone!. Here is our repository for Bangkit 2023 Capstone project. Our team consist of 3 Machine Learning, 2 Mobile Development, and 2 Cloud Computing.

# This is Foodection Repository
Foodection is an application designed to solve the problem of food waste on an ongoing basis. which can detect the freshness of food raw materials, which is expected to not only help users to choose food that is truly fresh so that it will reduce the possibility of food waste.

## Machine Learning
In the model building stage, the machine learning team utilizes the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Pillow
- Scikit-learn (Sklearn)
- NumPy

The team employs transfer learning techniques, implementing the RestNet50V2 architecture in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm to achieve the best model performance.


## Cloud Computing
The flow of making cloud computing is to create an architecture of the application to be created, then create a new project in gcp and activate the required api such as identity platform, firestore and so on. identity platform, firestore and so on. after that setting the app engine and cloud storage. Finally deploy the finished program or android.

## Mobile Development
This mobile application is developed using the Kotlin programming language within Android Studio. The key features of the application include leveraging the Firebase library as a database. Additionally, our innovative scan feature integrates a Machine Learning model through an API connection to the cloud. This model is designed to analyze photos of food, providing predictions on the freshness of the items.
